title:  "FEL: B35APO Computer Architectures"
---

Subject provides overview of basic building blocks of computer systems.  Explanation starts from hardware side where it extends knowledge  presented in the previous lectures of Structures of computer systems. Topics cover building blocks description, CPU structure, multiple  processors interconnections, input/output subsystem and basic overview  of network and buses topologies. Emphasis is placed on clarification of  interconnection of hardware components with software support, mainly  lower levels of operating systems, device drivers and virtualization  techniques. General principles are more elaborated during presentation  of examples of multiple standard CPU architectures. Exercises are more  focused on the software view to the contrary. Students are lead from  basic programming on CPU level to the interaction with raw hardware.
